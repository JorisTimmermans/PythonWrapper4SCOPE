This repository contains an implementation of a SCOPE wrapper. It uses a modified SCOPE version (in which the model has been deconstructed into a pre/run/post processing steps). This modified version of the SCOPE model can be found in 
"https://github.com/JorisTimmermans/SCOPE_mod", while the original version of the SCOPE model can be found at "https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE".

You can install the software with

    python setup.py install
